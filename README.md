# Koverage

**Koverage** is a Kotlin-based simulator for modelling and evaluating **network coverage** in industrial environments using **mobile sinks**, such as service vehicles, autonomous ground vehicles, or aerial drones.  

It supports a modular architecture to simulate various mobility behaviours and analyse wireless sensor network (WSN) coverage over time.

## ðŸš— Supported Mobility Models

Koverage currently supports three mobility models:

- **Random Waypoint** [Bettstetter, 2001]  
- **Random Direction** [Royer, 2001]  
- **Specialised Synthetic Model** [Amiri et al., 2024]  

ðŸ“Œ The *Specialised Synthetic Model* is a custom mobility model based on real-world trace data, designed to reflect structured vehicular motion in constrained environments such as industrial yards or logistics zones.

This model was presented at the **2024 International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC):**

## ðŸŽ“ Research Context

Koverage has been developed as part of ongoing PhD research by **Max Amiri**.  
It complements the **NTL â€“ Network Time Link** prototype by providing coverage evaluation and simulation insights for mobility-assisted IoT communication.

The concept has been published and can be cited as:
